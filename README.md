# Fission
Do you dislike Swing as much as I do? Well that's exactly what prompted the creation of this project.

This was made when using Swing just got unbearable. It's old, has no Kotlin features, and several other aspects are a supreme annoyance. AWT has similar problems.

Fission is basically a Swing / AWT wrapper sort of like Compose. It uses [JetBrain's Skiko](https://github.com/JetBrains/skiko), Kotlin, plus some extra libraries for stuff like SVG support.

The goal of Fission is to be easy to use, and include modern features. It is specifically targetting JVM for Desktop platforms, there is no effort to develop for mobile platforms, JavaScript, WebAssembly or other Kotlin Native platforms.
