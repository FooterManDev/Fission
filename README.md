# Fission
Swing and AWT are so unbearable to use today, especially in Kotlin. So I made a replacement, specificially for my [Tritium project](https://github.com/FooterManDev/Tritium-Launcher).

FissionUI focuses on ease of use, wrapping AWT features like Events and Frame handling, while wrapping Swing with Skiko, and making the most of Kotlin's features.
It also comes with some extra stuff, such as Sprite Drawing in Kotlin.



# Fission IO
Fission IO is written in Kotlin and Rust, aimed at providing fast and efficient methods for IO.


# What can I do with Fission?
Contribute to it, Fork it, Play with it, Drop it into a nice steaming hot soup, doesn't matter to me as long as you respect the license terms.
If you want to use Fission for your own project, just be aware this lib was specifically built for another project, so it may not fully suit your needs and wants.
